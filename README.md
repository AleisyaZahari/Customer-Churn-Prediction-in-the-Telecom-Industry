## 🛠 Project Workflow  
### 📂 1. Data Understanding & EDA  
   - Importing & exploring the dataset 🔍  
   - **Descriptive statistics:** Univariate & Bivariate analysis 📊  
   - Checking **outliers, normal distribution, and data correlation**  

### 🔧 2. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering  
   - Handling missing values & encoding categorical data  
   - **Feature selection** to enhance model performance  
   - Data scaling & transformation for better predictions  

### 🤖 3. Modeling & Evaluation  
   - Implementing **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, which achieved the best performance  
   - **Hyperparameter tuning** using Grid Search  
   - Evaluating model accuracy, recall, and precision  

### 📈 4. Business Insights & Findings  
   - **First-time users** have the **highest churn rate** ⚠️  
   - Customers with a **total international charge of 2.4 - 3.8** are in the **churn danger zone** 🚨  
   - A **churn rate spike** is observed among customers with **85-120 total days of calls**
